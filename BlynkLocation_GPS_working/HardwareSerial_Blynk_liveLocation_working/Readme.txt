As per analysis Software Serial is not working on ESP32 TTGO-TCALL board and due to the the presence of only one UART port we are using HardwareSerail to utilize GPIO pins as UART RX and TX.

RXD2->14
TXD2->12 



Problem: When we are getting real time location on Blynk app, text message and call features are not working. Need to resolve the isse.
